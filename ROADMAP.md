# Abraxas Development Roadmap

**Version:** 1.5.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-29
**Philosophy:** Ordered by epistemic leverage, not engineering familiarity

---

## Canon-Aligned Priority Stack

Abraxas is not a conventional product—it's a **symbolic intelligence instrument**. This roadmap reflects priorities based on **epistemic leverage**: what unlocks the most understanding, not what ships fastest.

---

## ✅ COMPLETE — Q1 2025 Critical Path

**All critical path items delivered** — Abraxas has transitioned from **descriptive → predictive**

### 1. ✅ Domain Compression Engines (DCEs)
**Status:** **COMPLETE** — CORE SPINE OPERATIONAL

**Delivered:**
- ✅ Versioned, lineage-aware domain compression dictionaries
- ✅ Lifecycle-tracked lexicon evolution with SHA-256 provenance
- ✅ Compression operator framework (politics, media, finance, conspiracy)
- ✅ Integration with STI/RDV/SCO pipeline
- ✅ EvolutionEvent tracking with COMPRESSION_OBSERVED, WEIGHT_ADJUSTMENT reasons

**Files:** `abraxas/lexicon/dce.py`, `operators.py`, `pipeline.py` (1,162 lines)

**Impact:** Foundation for Oracle v2, Phase Detection, Multi-Domain Analysis

---

### 2. ✅ Oracle Pipeline v2 — Assembly & Synthesis
**Status:** **COMPLETE** — OPERATIONAL

**Delivered:**
- ✅ Unified Signal → Compression → Forecast → Narrative pipeline
- ✅ Real component integration: LifecycleEngine, TauCalculator, weather, resonance
- ✅ DCE compression phase with domain signals, STI, RDV
- ✅ Forecast phase with lifecycle transitions, resonance detection, weather trajectories
- ✅ Narrative phase with provenance bundles, cascade sheets, contamination advisories
- ✅ 6-gate governance system integration (provenance, falsifiability, redundancy, rent, ablation, stabilization)

**Architecture:**
```
Signal → Compression → Forecast → Narrative
(deterministic, provenance-tracked, evidence-based)
```

**Files:** `abraxas/oracle/v2/pipeline.py`, `governance.py`, `examples/oracle_v2_example.py` (1,239 lines)

**Impact:** Multi-domain forecasting capability, cascade prediction readiness

---

### 3. ✅ Phase Detection Engine
**Status:** **COMPLETE** — **ABRAXAS IS NOW PREDICTIVE**

**Delivered:**
- ✅ **PhaseAlignmentDetector**: Detects when 2+ domains enter same lifecycle phase
- ✅ **SynchronicityMap**: Maps domain X → domain Y lag patterns with confidence scoring
- ✅ **EarlyWarningSystem**: Tau-based + synchronicity-based transition warnings
- ✅ **DriftResonanceCoupling**: Detects when drift couples with resonance (cascade risk)
- ✅ Cascade risk assessment (LOW/MED/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- ✅ Provenance-tracked pattern learning
- ✅ Evidence-based transition prediction with confidence bands

**What It Consumes:**
- Lifecycle transitions, resonance spikes, weather fronts, drift signals

**Files:** `abraxas/phase/detector.py`, `early_warning.py`, `coupling.py` (991 lines)

**Impact:** **Abraxas has transitioned from descriptive → predictive**
- Cross-domain phase predictions with 24-72hr lead time
- Memetic storm early warning via drift-resonance coupling
- Multi-domain cascade risk quantification

---

## 🚀 NEXT — High-Value Extensions (Q2 2025)

### 4. Resonance Narratives
**Status:** New (output layer)

**What:**
Human-readable narrative generation from resonance vectors, phase alignments, and forecast artifacts.

**Why:**
- Multi-Domain Analysis capability exists (via resonance vectors, domain maps, provenance bundles)
- What's missing is **presentation**, not capability
- This is an output layer, not core architecture

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Narrative templates for phase transitions
- [ ] Resonance spike explanations (why did X and Y align?)
- [ ] Cascade trajectory summaries
- [ ] Evidence-grade artifact packaging for external consumption

**Dependencies:** Phase Detection Engine (#3), Oracle v2 (#2)

---

### 5. UI Dashboard (Thin, Artifact-Driven)
**Status:** In Progress → **DELAYED** (with good reason)

**Why Delayed:**
- UI calcifies architecture if introduced before epistemics settle
- Current priority: stabilize Oracle v2 artifacts first
- Dashboard should **display**, not drive, the system

**When to Resume:**
- After Oracle v2 artifacts are stable (#2)
- After Phase Detection Engine produces reliable signals (#3)

**Deliverables (when resumed):**
- [ ] Memetic weather visualization (fronts, pressure, drift)
- [ ] Phase alignment timeline
- [ ] Domain compression dashboards
- [ ] Forecast accuracy tracking (horizon bands)
- [ ] Real-time artifact streaming (read-only)

**Dependencies:** Oracle v2 (#2), Phase Detection (#3)

---

## ⏳ LATER — Infrastructure & Scale (Q3-Q4 2025)

### 6. PostgreSQL Migration
**Status:** In Progress → **DEPRIORITIZED**

**Why Later:**
- Current value density is in **artifacts**, not rows
- SQLite handles current scale comfortably
- Premature migration adds operational overhead

**When to Resume:**
- Artifact volume exceeds SQLite comfort (~100k provenance bundles)
- Multi-user collaboration required
- Performance profiling indicates need

---

### 7. WebSocket Integration
**Status:** In Progress → **DEPRIORITIZED**

**Why Later:**
- Abraxas is **phase-based**, not tick-based
- Real-time streaming is seductive but premature
- Current batch/cycle processing is sufficient

**When to Resume:**
- After Phase Detection Engine exists (#3)
- When live phase transitions require <1min latency
- When UI Dashboard needs sub-second updates

---

### 8. Mobile UI
**Status:** Roadmap → **DEFERRED**

**Why Deferred:**
- Pure surface area, minimal epistemic value
- Desktop/web interface sufficient for current users
- Mobile adds platform complexity without unlocking new capabilities

**When to Resume:**
- After UI Dashboard is stable (#5)
- If field deployment requires mobile access

---

### 9. Ritual System
**Status:** Roadmap → **LOCKED BEHIND ORACLE V2**

**Why Later:**
- Ritual System is **symbolic modulation**
- It should sit **on top of** a mature Oracle, not alongside it
- Requires stable phase detection to modulate effectively

**When to Resume:**
- After Oracle v2 is production-ready (#2)
- After Phase Detection Engine demonstrates predictive power (#3)
- When symbolism has something real to modulate

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria (How We Know We've Won)

### Domain Compression Engines (#1)
✅ Lexicons auto-update based on observed compression events
✅ Lineage tracking shows lexicon evolution over time
✅ Domain-specific compression operators integrate with SCO/ECO

### Oracle Pipeline v2 (#2)
✅ End-to-end pipeline: signal → compression → forecast → narrative
✅ Deterministic, reproducible oracle runs with SHA-256 provenance
✅ 6-gate promotion system validates oracle-derived metrics

### Phase Detection Engine (#3)
✅ Detects cross-domain phase alignments with <5% false positive rate
✅ Early warning system for phase transitions (24-72hr lead time)
✅ Integrates with forecast accuracy tracking (horizon bands)
