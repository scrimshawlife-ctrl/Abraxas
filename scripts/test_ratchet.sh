# Fails if the test suite regresses past the recorded baselines.
#
# TWO baselines live here, so CI and humans read the same numbers:
#
#   BASELINE_FAILURES   may only ever DECREASE. Lower it in the same commit that fixes
#                       a cluster. Mirrors tests/test_coupling_lint.py
#                       (MAX_ALLOWED_VIOLATIONS).
#
#   BASELINE_COLLECTED  may only ever INCREASE. Raise it when tests are added.
#                       A DROP means tests stopped being COLLECTED -- which produces no
#                       FAILED and no ERROR line, so BASELINE_FAILURES cannot see it.
#                       Without this floor a whole module can silently stop running
#                       and the ratchet still reports OK.
#
# See docs/TEST_DEBT.md for the cluster breakdown behind the current numbers.

#
# `core/` here is a NAMESPACE package (no __init__.py). A stale editable install
# (abraxas-v2) puts another checkout on sys.path whose `core/` is a REGULAR package,
# and a regular package beats a namespace portion regardless of sys.path order. On
# such an interpreter every `import core.*` resolves into that other checkout and 28
# test modules fail to collect with a bare ModuleNotFoundError -- which reads like a
# broken repo rather than the wrong interpreter.
#
# The check compares each candidate search location against <repo>/core, which works
# for namespace packages too (their `origin` is None, so checking `origin` would be
# wrong here).
