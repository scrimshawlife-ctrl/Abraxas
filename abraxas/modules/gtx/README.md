# GTX — Game Theory eXperiments

## Meta-corpus (local-only)
Create a local vault for game-theory materials:

```
~/.aal/vault/gtx/
├── notes/
├── papers/
├── excerpts/
└── index.json
```

`index.json` fields:
- title, author, year
- domain tags (repeated-games, signaling, etc.)
- abx_hooks (oracle / memetics / neon)

## Core domains
1. Strategic form basics (Nash, dominant strategies, mixed strategies)
2. Repeated games (cooperation, punishment, forgiveness, noise)
3. Signaling & information (cheap talk, costly signals, screening)
4. Mechanism design (incentive compatibility, auctions, principal-agent)
5. Network games (cascades, contagion, coordination on graphs)
