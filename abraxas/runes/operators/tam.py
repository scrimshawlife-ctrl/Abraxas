"""ABX-Rune Operator: ϟ₂ TAM

AUTO-GENERATED OPERATOR STUB
Rune: ϟ₂ TAM — Traversal-as-Meaning
Layer: Core
Motto: Meaning is the walk, not the map.

Canonical statement:
  Meaning emerges from path selection, not linear transmission.

Function:
  Treats meaning generation as emergent from path traversal rather than static transmission. Prioritizes dynamic interpretation over fixed semantics.

Inputs: traversal_path, node_sequence, context_history
Outputs: emergent_meaning, path_signature, semantic_trace

Constraints:
  - meaning_emerges_from_selection; no_predetermined_endpoints; path_dependent_interpretation

Provenance:
    - Star Gauge / Xuanji Tu traversal logic
  - Dynamic semantic graph theory
  - AAL traversal doctrine
