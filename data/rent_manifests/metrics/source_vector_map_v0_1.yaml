# Rent Manifest: Source Vector Map Registry v0.1

id: "source_vector_map_v0_1"
kind: "metric"
version: "0.1.0"

description: |
  Discovery registry mapping semantic nodes to OSH allowlist sources.
  This is NOT a scraper - it only maps topics to existing sources.

improves:
  - "semantic_discovery"
  - "source_organization"
  - "cadence_planning"

measurable_by:
  - "node_coverage"
  - "allowlist_compliance"
  - "validation_pass_rate"

rent_claim:
  complexity:
    loc: 350  # vector_map_loader.py
    cognitive: 3  # Simple: registry lookup
    dependencies: ["OSH", "YAML config"]

  thresholds:
    # Conservative start - just require registry to load
    registry_loads: true
    all_nodes_valid: true
    all_sources_in_allowlist: true  # Must reference existing sources

  cost_model:
    time_ms_expected: 5  # Per registry load
    memory_kb_expected: 50  # Per registry

  rationale: |
    Provides semantic organization of OSH sources without doing scraping.
    Maps topics/themes to allowlist entries for discovery hints.

  alternatives_considered:
    - "Auto-discovery from MW (rejected: too dynamic for v0.1)"
    - "No registry (rejected: loss of semantic organization)"
