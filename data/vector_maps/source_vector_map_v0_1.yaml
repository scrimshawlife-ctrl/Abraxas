# Source Vector Map v0.1
#
# PURPOSE:
# This is a DISCOVERY registry, NOT a scraper.
# It maps semantic nodes (topics/themes) to OSH allowlist sources.
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
# - Declares "where to look" for certain topics
# - Links semantic nodes to allowlist source_ids
# - Provides cadence hints for schedulers
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO:
# - Does NOT fetch content (that's OSH's job)
# - Does NOT bypass allowlists (only references existing entries)
# - Does NOT add new sources without explicit allowlist entries
