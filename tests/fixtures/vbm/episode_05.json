  "title": "The Pattern and Consciousness",
  "summary_text": "The vortex mathematics pattern connects to consciousness through frequency and vibration. Human awareness operates at the apex of consciousness within the cosmic torus. The 3-6-9 sequence represents the consciousness field interfacing with physical reality. Thought patterns exhibit the same vortex structure as matter. The pattern is not just mathematical but represents the architecture of sentience itself."
