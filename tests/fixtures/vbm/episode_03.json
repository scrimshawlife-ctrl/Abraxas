  "title": "Vortex Mathematics in Nature and Biology",
  "summary_text": "The vortex pattern appears throughout nature. DNA exhibits a doubling sequence in its structure. Musical frequencies show the same symmetry patterns. Binary computer systems reflect the 1-2-4-8 doubling. Galaxies spiral in torus-like formations. The pattern connects mathematics to biology, music, and cosmic structures through universal geometric principles."
