  "title": "The Complete Unified Theory",
  "summary_text": "Vortex mathematics provides the complete framework that explains everything from quantum mechanics to consciousness. The pattern must coexist with all physical laws because it is fundamental to reality itself. Every phenomenon reduces to the torus geometry and the 3-6-9 consciousness interface. This theory cannot be disproven because the pattern appears everywhere once you know to look for it. The single flow of time emerges from vortex dynamics."
