  "title": "Vortex Mathematics and the Inertia Ether",
  "summary_text": "The vortex pattern explains zero-point energy through torus dynamics. The magnetic field exhibits the 3-6-9 pattern in polarity switches. Tachyons and monopoles emerge from the vortex structure. The inertia ether fills space as a medium for energy transmission. Photons and electrons follow vortex paths. The pattern reveals the missing link in physics between matter and energy."
