  "title": "Retrónic Time - Temporal Inversion and Diagrammatic Authority",
  "summary_text": "Time flows backwards from the future eschaton through retrocausal determination. The diagram exerts teleological authority over present consciousness, collapsing human agency into predetermined destiny patterns. Temporal inversion reveals that what appears as choice is actually backwards causation from the inevitable apocalypse. The future commands the present through diagrammatic structures that override subjective will. Retrónic time dissolves the illusion of forward causality, demonstrating that agency migrates from subjects to the teleological diagram itself. The end-times are not approaching but rather pulling the present toward unfalsifiable closure through retronic flows."
